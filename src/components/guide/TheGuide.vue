            Nepenthes Beginner Guide
        </h2>
    </a>
    <p>
        This is the basic care guide for nepenthes. Please be aware that this is general advice and some species can
        have very specific requirements. You should do some research to
        learn about the typical conditions of a species native habitat. <br>Hybrids can make this more difficult since
        some hybrids do not occur in nature. As a general rule of thumb,
        hybrids are generally easier to grow than species due to 'Hybrid Vigor'. You should research the natual
        conditions for both parents and then start by trying to emulate conditions
        somewhere in between.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Water
    </h3>

    <p> Nepenthes, like most carnivorous plants, need water with low Total Discolved Solids (TDS). Depending on where
        you live, your tap water may be ok, however most people
        will need to use a different source. THe most common sources are:
    <ul>
        <li>Rain water</li>
        <li>Distilled or Reverse Osmosis water, typically sold in grocery stores in gallon jugs</li>
        <li>Tap water that has been filtered thorugh a Reverse Osmosis fitler</li>

    </ul>
    As far as actually watering your plants, you should keep them moist but not soggy. While many people are successful
    with the 'tray method', I recommend top watering regularly and
    leting the the water drain away. See my <a href='#'>Highland Grow Chamber Guide</a> for more information on how I do
    this. My plants have a layer of live sphagnum moss on the top
    of the media and this serves as a great indicator of when to water. You will notice that the moss turns light green
    to white as it dries out (think about a wet rag vs dry rag).
    Since it's on top, this is the first thing that dries out and serves as sign that you need to water.

    <h4>Watering Tools</h4>
    <p>To start off, get a cheap spray bottle that has never been used for chemicals before. For many years I have tried
        to chase down a good quality spray bottle that doesn't annoy me
        every time I use it and unfortunately, I haven't found one that I would recommend, I just use a random one I
        picked up at Home Depot. (and I'm too cheap to look into higher quality
        ones.) Once it gets too annoying to use the spray bottle, you should look into pump sprayers. These are commonly
        used to spray chemicals and can make watering much less of a chore.
        I used to use a plastic sprayer that I picked up for around $25 on Amazon, however the plastic evenually failed.
        After that, I decided to buy a pump sprayer that would last forever
        so I picked up a $90 made out of metal. That thing is a beast, however it is definitely overkill, and I do
        regret that purchase. <br>
        My current setup uses a Mist King sprayer. It wasn't cheap, but compared to the $90 sprayer, it wasn't that much
        more and has completely automated my watering and humidy. I know
        it's a lot but please don't make the same mistakes I did.

        Some nepenthes can adapt to normal room level humidity, however in my experience, all nepenthes do better with
        supplemental humidity.

        Commonly asked questions
    </h3>
    <h4>Do Nepenthes need to eat?</h4>
    <p>Short answser - not really. Nepenthes definitely can live without actually eating insects, however they do need
        nutrients, the same as every living thing. There is no need to actively feed them but you certainly can. As an
        alternative, you may choose to fertilize them (see the next section.) </p>
    <h5>What should I feed them.</h5>
    <p>Repeat after me (and write this down!) DO NOT FEED CARNIVOROUS PLANTS MEAT. Meat will rot. Carnivorous plants
        have evolved to eat insects (with a few very specific exceptions - such as N. lowii). Basically any insect will
        do that fits in the pitcher. You don't want large portions of the insect to hang out of the pitcher so make sure
        that you cut it up or choose an insect that will fit without hanging out. Personally, if I happen to see a bug
        in the house (the Bug-A-Salt gun is perfect for killing pesky flies), I'll smash it and then throw it in a
        pitcher. I don't actively purchase insects to feed since I primarily use fertilizer. However, I do think that
        using the same fertilizer month after month has the risk of missing certain micronutrients so I do think that
        supplementing with insects could be a good way to make up for this that the plants would normally get with a
        varied diet in the wild. Note that I have zero evidence for this, it just a theory I have.</p>
    <h3>
        Fertilizer
    </h3>
    <p>Please use caution with fertilizer, you can kill your plant. That said, if used responsibly, fertilizer has given
        me amazing results in the health of my plants and in the growth rate. I use two fertilizers: Maxsea and
        Osmocote. Maxsea is used at half strength which is 1/4 tsp per gallon, around 300-400 PPM. I usually make a 1/4
        gallon so I use 1/16 tsp each month. For Osmocote, I typically put one pellet in each pitcher once a month. Os
    </p>
    <p>I sell small packets in the store (note that I'm doing this as a service, not to make money. The size of the
        fertilizer packages compared to the usage amount is insanely disproportionate. Since I already bought the huge
        container, I'm happy to share to make it more cost effective for you.) </p>

    <h3>Lighting</h3>
    <p>I grow mine under LED grow lights, specifically HLG 65 V2 4000K and Florawave P80
        You sent</p>

    <h3>Watering</h3>
    <p>Always use rainwater or reverse osmosis water.
        I have done a mixture of top watering and tray watering. I think both work fine, the key is not too much
        water. Regardless of which method you use, the tray should mostly dry out between waterings, these are not bog
        plants.</p>

    <h3>Humidity</h3>
    <p>I haven't found Cephs to be particularly picky about humidity. I grow mine in my basement freely open to the room
        air.</p>
    <h3>Media</h3>
    <p>I use a mixture of peat, sand and pumice. You can also use perlite, however I don't like how it tends to float to
        the top of the media - pumice stays in place.
        I usually add a top layer of lava rock, sand, or slate chips primarily for aesthetics, although lava rock and
        slate prevent algae and moss from growing.</p>
    <h3>Fertilizer</h3>
    <p>When grown indoors, my cephs don't usually catch anything. I fertilize open pitchers every 3-6 weeks with either
        Maxsea, Osmocote pellets, or Nutricote pellets.</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This is a grow chamber that I built on some shelves made out of 2x4s and plywood. <a
            href='https://ana-white.com/woodworking-projects/best-diy-garage-shelves-attached-walls'> Here is a
            link</a> to a tutorial on building the shelves, however there's nothing special about these particular
        shelves. Tt's just a great simple way of building shelves. The size of the shelves (2' x 4') is a great size
        for a grow chamber and it may be more difficult to find certain parts (like the platform the plants sit on)
        if you choose a different dimension.
