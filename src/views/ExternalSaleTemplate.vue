        Multiple well established nepenthes rooted cuttings for sale. Cuttings were taken in June 2022. The plants in
        the
        listing are representative of the plant for sale, photos of the adult pitchers. You will receive a similar or
        larger
        size plant.

        The plant will be shipped bare root. 72 hour heat pack available - please select 'Standard Shipping' for $13 for
        cold
        weather shipping.

        I'm happy to answer any questions about the plant or growing conditions. Many of these would be great species
        for
        beginners or to add to an existing collection.

    <h1>eBay Heli</h1>
    This auction is for a Heliamphora pulchella division. This division was taken in the spring of 2022 and is well
    established, rooted and making new pitchers. I have multiple plants available, the plant in the photo is one of them
    but
    may not be the actual plant you receive. All plants will be this size or larger.


    The plant will be shipped potted. If the plant arrives with any significant damage or you have any reason to believe
    it
    was exposed to extreme heat or cold, please contact me as soon as possible.


    I'm happy to answer any questions about the plant or growing conditions. This species is easy to grow, maybe not a
    great
    idea as your first Heliamphora but if you can care for H. minor, you can grow this species.
