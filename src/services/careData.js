            fertilizer: "You can feed live, dead, or even dried insects to your plants as food.  If you would rather not, or to supplement these feedings, here are a few options for fertilizers.  I generally rotate between these three for variety, and apply every 2-4 weeks: Maxsea - kelp based fertilizer that is mixed with water and                sprayed on leaves and in pitchers. I use 1/8tsp per gallon. Osmocote - pellets that can be placed in pitchers and will release slowly when temperatures rise &#62; 75&deg;F. Nutricote - pellets that can be placed in pitchers and will release slowly with exposure to water/pitcher fluid.",

                light: "Light requirements vary by species and as such, you should research the natural conditions of yours species. Generally, most nepenthes grow in a forest and are shaded for much of the day, thus they don't need particularly high light levels. If grown in a greenhouse, shade cloth is required.",

                temperature: "Nepenthes generally fall into three categories: Highland: these plants live at high elevations and require temperature drops of 10-20Â°F at night. Intermediate: plants that live between the highland and lowland areas and can adapt to a wide range of conditions. Lowland: these plants live at low elevations in hot, humid conditions and may require heating above normal room temps.",

                water: "Since Heliamphora natually get a tremendous amount of rain, I generally give them more water than my Nepenthes and I make sure to fill the pitchers with each watering.",
                temperature: "I grow most of my Heliamphora at mostly intermediate conditions, avoiding temperatures above 79Â°F. Some more advanced species do require cooler temperatures.",
